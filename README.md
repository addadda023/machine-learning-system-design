# Machine Learning System Design
## Motivation
Machine Learning systems are integral part of distributed system backend pipeline these days. 
This repo is an organized collection of resources to help you learn design production ML systems at scale. 
A lot of concepts of distributed system design is common to ML system design. 
You're encouraged to review [distributed system design concepts first.](https://github.com/donnemartin/system-design-primer) 

In an interview setting there are 3 main considerations:
* Data related activities (data engineering).
* Model related activities (modeling).
* Deployment and scaling.

In a 40 min interview setting discussion in detail all of above may not be feasible.
Depending on the interviewer's guide and your expertise, you might want to emphasize in
one section. As always, one should know advantage/disadvantage of design decision they make and justify
that to the interviewer.
